The console will automatically print anything and everything that you would find in the "Console" tab in the editor. You can click any entry to see the details.

Use Prefabs/Console on any object inside a canvas and it will automatically size itself to its parent. 
Make sure the parent has a size bigger than 0 or it will not appear.

Alternative:
Use Prefabs/ConsoleCanvas on the root of your scene. This is a whole canvas that needs no configuration.
